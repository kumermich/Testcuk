	* @return String containing extracted text
	*/
	try:
	from PIL import Image
	except ImportError:
	import Image
	import pytesseract
	
	# If tesseract executable is not in your PATH, include the following:
	# pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r''
	
	# Simple image to string
	text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('test.png'))
	print(text)
\end{verbatim}

This basic implementation provides a foundation for more complex OCR applications \cite{Nutrient.io:2025}.
