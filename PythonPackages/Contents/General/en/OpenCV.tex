\chapter{Package \PYTHON{OpenCV}}

\section{Introduction}

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision package) is an open-source software package developed to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications. Since its initial release by Intel in 2000, it has grown to be a vital resource for the computer vision community, enabling the quick creation and implementation of computer vision projects. OpenCV is available to a wide variety of developers and researchers because to its support for numerous programming languages, such as C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB. With its wide range of features, which include real-time image processing, video recording, and analysis, the package is a vital resource for sectors including robotics, automotive, healthcare, and surveillance.

Significant improvements and applications have been made to OpenCV in recent years. It is essential to autonomous driving technologies, for instance, as it helps with lane tracking, object detection, and driver support features. Through the processing of satellite imagery, OpenCV is used in agriculture to monitor crop health and manage resources effectively. The package's powers go beyond solving pressing global issues like climate change; it makes sophisticated environmental monitoring via three-dimensional computer vision possible. Its progress is also heavily influenced by ethical issues, such as prejudice and privacy, which guarantee the responsible use of computer vision technologies.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2023,OpenCVTeam:2024b}

\section{Description}

OpenCV is a versatile and powerful open-source package designed for real-time computer vision and image processing tasks. It includes a vast collection of algorithms and functions for image manipulation, object detection, face recognition, machine learning, and 3D reconstruction. Developers can create complex, incredibly effective, and efficient computer vision applications by utilizing the package's extensive features. The package's cross-platform features make it compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, increasing its accessibility for a wider range of users.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

For example, consider a basic task such as converting a color image to grayscale using OpenCV. This operation involves using the cv2.cvtColor function in Python, which changes the color space of the image. Here is a sample code snippet demonstrating this process:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Converting a color image to grayscale using OpenCV]
	import cv2
	
	# Load a color image
	image = cv2.imread('color_image.jpg')
	
	# Convert the image to grayscale
	gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	
	# Display the original and grayscale images
	cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
	cv2.imshow('Grayscale Image', gray_image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/grayscale"}
	\caption{Grey Image}\label{grayscale}
\end{figure}

In this example, the cv2.imread function reads an image from the file system, and cv2.cvtColor converts it from the BGR color space (the default for OpenCV) to grayscale. The cv2.imshow function is used to display the original and processed images. This straightforward example illustrates how OpenCV simplifies complex image processing tasks, making it accessible even for those new to computer vision.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\subsection{Key features}
OpenCV is a comprehensive package designed to facilitate the development of computer vision applications. With its wide range of features and optimizations, it may be used for both large-scale projects and real-time applications. In the realm of computer vision, OpenCV stands out for the following reasons:

\textbf{Extensive Collection of Algorithms:} OpenCV includes over 2500 optimized algorithms, which cover a wide range of applications from basic image processing (e.g., filtering, transformation) to advanced machine learning techniques for computer vision tasks. These algorithms enable developers to perform operations like object detection, facial recognition, and image segmentation with high efficiency.

\textbf{Cross-Platform and Multi-Language Support:} The package supports multiple programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB, and can run on various operating systems including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android. This cross-platform compatibility ensures that OpenCV can be integrated into diverse development environments and applications.

\textbf{Real-Time Processing Capabilities:} OpenCV is optimized for real-time performance, making it ideal for applications that require immediate processing of visual data, such as video surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. The package leverages hardware acceleration through CUDA and OpenCL to enhance performance on supported devices.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2023,OpenCVTeam:2024b}

\subsection{Architecture}

The broad and flexible architecture of OpenCV enables developers to effectively handle many facets of computer vision and image processing. Fundamentally, OpenCV is divided into a number of modules, each of which performs a particular set of tasks. Among the main modules are ml, calib3d, features2d, video, imgproc, core, and others. Essential functions for mathematical operations and algorithm support are provided by the core module, along with fundamental data structures like the Mat object, which is used to store images and matrices. Developers may easily conduct extensive image manipulations due to the imgproc module, which handles image processing tasks like filtering, transformations, and color space conversions.

With features for object tracking, background subtraction, and motion analysis, the video module is designed with video analysis in mind and is appropriate for real-time applications. Tools for 3D reconstruction and camera calibration are available in the calib3d module. These are necessary for jobs involving spatial measurements and 3D vision. For object identification and matching applications, the features2d module contains techniques like SIFT, SURF, and ORB for feature detection and descriptor extraction. Last but not least, the ml module contains machine learning tools and methods that enable the pipeline for computer vision to include classifiers and predictive models.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

Cross-platform compatibility and speed improvement are also prioritized in OpenCV's architecture. Through the use of multi-threading, SIMD instructions, and GPU processing with CUDA and OpenCL, it provides hardware acceleration, which greatly improves the performance of computationally demanding workloads. Although OpenCV is mostly developed in C++, it also has bindings for Python, Java, and MATLAB, so it may be used in a variety of programming contexts. Because of the package's modular architecture, developers can reduce overhead and increase efficiency by just including the components that are required in their projects.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\section{Example - Basic Concepts of OpenCV}
\subsection{Reading Images and Video}
\subsubsection{Reading Images}
Reading an image in OpenCV is straightforward using the \PYTHON{cv2.imread()} function. This function reads an image from the specified file and returns it as a NumPy array.\cite{Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	import cv2
	
	# Reading an image
	image = cv2.imread('Readimage.jpg')
	# Display the image
	cv2.imshow('Image', image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/Readimage"}
	\caption{Read Image}\label{Readimage}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Reading Videos}
To read video files, OpenCV provides the \texttt{cv2.VideoCapture} class. This class can capture video from a file or a camera.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	import cv2
	
	# Capture video from a file
	cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path_to_video.mp4')
	
	while cap.isOpened():
	ret, frame = cap.read()
	if not ret:
	break
	# Display the frame
	cv2.imshow('Video', frame)
	if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
	break
	
	cap.release()
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Resizing and Rescaling Images and Video Frames}
\subsubsection{Resizing Images}
Resizing is changing the dimensions of an image. This can be done using the \PYTHON{cv2.resize()} function, which allows specifying the desired width and height.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	import cv2
	
	# Read an image
	image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
	# Resize the image to 50% of its original dimensions
	resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (0, 0), fx=0.5, fy=0.5)
	# Display the resized image
	cv2.imshow('Resized Image', resized_image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Rescaling Images}
Rescaling involves adjusting the size of the image with respect to a specific scaling factor. This is particularly useful when you want to maintain the aspect ratio.\cite{Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	import cv2
	
	def rescale_frame(frame, scale=0.75):
	width = int(frame.shape[1] * scale)
	height = int(frame.shape[0] * scale)
	dimensions = (width, height)
	return cv2.resize(frame, dimensions, interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
	
	# Read an image
	image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
	# Rescale the image
	rescaled_image = rescale_frame(image, scale=0.5)
	# Display the rescaled image
	cv2.imshow('Rescaled Image', rescaled_image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Resizing Video Frames}
Similar to resizing images, video frames can also be resized during the capture process. This is done frame-by-frame using \PYTHON{cv2.resize()}.\cite{Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	import cv2
	
	def rescale_frame(frame, scale=0.75):
	width = int(frame.shape[1] * scale)
	height = int(frame.shape[0] * scale)
	dimensions = (width, height)
	return cv2.resize(frame, dimensions, interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
	
	# Capture video from a file
	cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path_to_video.mp4')
	
	while cap.isOpened():
	ret, frame = cap.read()
	if not ret:
	break
	# Rescale the frame
	frame_rescaled = rescale_frame(frame, scale=0.5)
	# Display the frame
	cv2.imshow('Rescaled Video', frame_rescaled)
	if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
	break
	
	cap.release()
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection {OpenCV Drawing Shapes and Placing Text on Images}

One of its capabilities is drawing shapes and placing text on images, which is useful for annotations, visualizations, and other graphic applications. Here, we discuss few essential methods for drawing shapes and placing text on images using OpenCV.

\subsubsection{Drawing Lines}

The \PYTHON{cv2.line()} function in OpenCV is used to draw a line on an image. The function takes several parameters, including the image, the start and end coordinates of the line, the color, thickness, and line type.\cite{Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}
	import cv2
	import numpy as np
	
	# Create a black image
	image = np.zeros((512, 512, 3), np.uint8)
	
	# Draw a white line with thickness of 5 px
	cv2.line(image, (0, 0), (511, 511), (255, 255, 255), 5)
	
	# Display the image
	cv2.imshow("Line", image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Drawing Rectangles}

The \PYTHON{cv2.rectangle()} function is used to draw a rectangle on an image. It requires parameters such as the image, the top-left and bottom-right corner coordinates of the rectangle, the color, and thickness.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}
	# Create a black image
	image = np.zeros((512, 512, 3), np.uint8)
	
	# Draw a blue rectangle with thickness of 3 px
	cv2.rectangle(image, (100, 100), (400, 400), (255, 0, 0), 3)
	
	# Display the image
	cv2.imshow("Rectangle", image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Drawing Circles}

The \PYTHON{cv2.circle()} function is used to draw a circle. It takes parameters like the image, the center coordinates of the circle, the radius, the color, and thickness.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}
	# Create a black image
	image = np.zeros((512, 512, 3), np.uint8)
	
	# Draw a red circle with radius of 100 px
	cv2.circle(image, (256, 256), 100, (0, 0, 255), -1)
	
	# Display the image
	cv2.imshow("Circle", image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/Circles and Rectangles"}
	\caption{Drawing Circles and Rectangles}\label{Circles and Rectangles}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Placing Text}

The \PYTHON{cv2.putText()} function allows you to place text on an image. This function takes parameters like the image, the text string, the bottom-left corner of the text, font type, font scale, color, thickness, and line type.\cite{Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}
	# Create a black image
	image = np.zeros((512, 512, 3), np.uint8)
	
	# Put white text on the image
	cv2.putText(image, 'Hello', (10, 500), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 4, (255, 255, 255), 2, cv2.LINE_AA)
	
	# Display the image
	cv2.imshow("Text", image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/Text"}
	\caption{Placing Text}\label{Placing Text}
\end{figure}

\subsection {Image Transformations}
Image transformations entail modifying an image's pixel values to produce a range of effects, including scaling, rotation, translation, and more. These transformations are essential for image processing and computer vision applications because they give the necessary tools for data augmentation, feature enhancement, and image preprocessing for improved analysis.

\subsubsection{Translation}

Translation shifts an image by a certain offset along the X and Y axes. It is achieved by constructing a translation matrix and applying it to the image using the \texttt{cv2.warpAffine} function.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Translation]
	import cv2
	import numpy as np
	
	image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
	rows, cols = image.shape[:2]
	
	translation_matrix = np.float32([[1, 0, 100], [0, 1, 50]])
	translated_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, translation_matrix, (cols, rows))
	
	cv2.imshow('Translated Image', translated_image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/Translated"}
	\caption{Image Translation}\label{Image Translation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Rotation}

Rotation rotates an image around a specified point by a certain angle. The rotation matrix can be created using \texttt{cv2.getRotationMatrix2D} and applied using \texttt{cv2.warpAffine}.\cite{flaskrestfuldocumentation:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Rotation]
	angle = 45
	center = (cols // 2, rows // 2)
	rotation_matrix = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(center, angle, 1.0)
	rotated_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, rotation_matrix, (cols, rows))
	
	cv2.imshow('Rotated Image', rotated_image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/RotatedImage"}
	\caption{Image Rotation}\label{Image Rotation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scaling}
Scaling resizes an image either by enlarging or shrinking it. This can be performed using \texttt{cv2.resize} with different interpolation methods.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Scaling]
	scale_factor = 1.5
	scaled_image = cv2.resize(image, None, fx=scale_factor, fy=scale_factor, interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)
	
	cv2.imshow('Scaled Image', scaled_image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Affine Transformation}
Affine transformations preserve lines and parallelism but not necessarily distances and angles. It is achieved by mapping three points from the source image to the destination image.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Affine Transformation]
	src_points = np.float32([[50, 50], [200, 50], [50, 200]])
	dst_points = np.float32([[10, 100], [200, 50], [100, 250]])
	affine_matrix = cv2.getAffineTransform(src_points, dst_points)
	affine_transformed_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, affine_matrix, (cols, rows))
	
	cv2.imshow('Affine Transformed Image', affine_transformed_image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Contour Detection}

Contour detection is a crucial technique in computer vision, used to detect and analyze the boundaries of objects within an image. Contours are curves joining all the continuous points along a boundary having the same color or intensity. OpenCV provides powerful functions to detect, analyze, and draw contours.

\subsubsection{Detecting Contours}
Contours can be detected using the \texttt{cv2.findContours} function, which retrieves the contours from a binary image. Before finding contours, the image is typically converted to grayscale and then thresholded or edge-detected using methods like Canny.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Detecting Contours]
	gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	ret, thresholded_image = cv2.threshold(gray_image, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
	
	contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresholded_image, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
	
	# Draw all contours
	cv2.drawContours(image, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)
	cv2.imshow('Contours', image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/Greycat"}
	\caption{Detecting Contours}\label{Detecting Contours}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/GreycatCanny"}
	\caption{Detecting Contours Canny}\label{Detecting Contours Canny}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Approximating Contours}
Contour approximation reduces the number of points in a contour, simplifying its shape. This can be done using \texttt{cv2.approxPolyDP}, which approximates a contour to another shape with fewer vertices.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Approximating Contours]
	contour = contours[0]
	epsilon = 0.01 * cv2.arcLength(contour, True)
	approx_contour = cv2.approxPolyDP(contour, epsilon, True)
	
	cv2.drawContours(image, [approx_contour], -1, (0, 0, 255), 3)
	cv2.imshow('Approximated Contours', image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Bounding Rectangles and Circles}
Bounding shapes are often used to enclose contours. The \texttt{cv2.boundingRect} function computes the bounding rectangle for a contour, while \texttt{cv2.minEnclosingCircle} finds the smallest circle enclosing the contour.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Bounding Rectangles and Circles]
	x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
	cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)
	
	(x, y), radius = cv2.minEnclosingCircle(contour)
	center = (int(x), int(y))
	radius = int(radius)
	cv2.circle(image, center, radius, (0, 255, 0), 2)
	
	cv2.imshow('Bounding Shapes', image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Convex Hull}
The convex hull of a shape is the smallest convex boundary that can enclose the shape. It can be calculated using \texttt{cv2.convexHull}.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Convex Hull]
	hull = cv2.convexHull(contour)
	cv2.drawContours(image, [hull], -1, (0, 255, 255), 3)
	
	cv2.imshow('Convex Hull', image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Example - Advanced Concepts of OpenCV}

\subsection{Switching Between Colour Spaces in OpenCV}

A fundamental idea in computer vision and image processing is color spaces. A popular package in this field, OpenCV, offers robust support for translating images between several color spaces. For applications like object detection, feature extraction, and image segmentation, this functionality is essential. In this document, we discuss the conversion between several common colour spaces: RGB, BGR, Grayscale, HSV, and Lab. 

\subsubsection{RGB to BGR and Vice Versa}

In OpenCV, images are typically read in BGR format, which is the default for many functions, including \PYTHON{cv2.imread()}. However, many applications and packages, such as \texttt{matplotlib}, use the RGB format. Converting between these formats is straightforward and involves swapping the red and blue channels.\cite{Dawson:2014}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Converting BGR to RGB in OpenCV]
	import cv2
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	
	# Read an image in BGR format
	image_bgr = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
	
	# Convert BGR to RGB
	image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image_bgr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
	
	# Display the image using matplotlib
	plt.imshow(image_rgb)
	plt.title('Image in RGB format')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{RGB/BGR to Grayscale}

Grayscale images are often used in image processing to simplify the data and reduce computational requirements. Converting a colour image to grayscale involves reducing the three colour channels (R, G, B) to a single intensity channel.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Converting BGR to Grayscale in OpenCV]
	# Convert BGR to Grayscale
	image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(image_bgr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	
	# Display the grayscale image
	plt.imshow(image_gray, cmap='gray')
	plt.title('Grayscale Image')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Technical Detail:} The conversion to grayscale is done using the formula 
\[ Y = 0.299 \cdot R + 0.587 \cdot G + 0.114 \cdot B \]
where \( Y \) is the luminance value.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/GrayBaston"}
	\caption{RGB/BGR to Grayscale}\label{Grayscale Image}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{RGB/BGR to HSV}

The HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) colour space is useful for image analysis tasks where colour information is important, but the lighting conditions may vary. Hue represents the type of colour, saturation represents the vibrancy, and value represents the brightness.\cite{Dawson:2014}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Converting BGR to HSV in OpenCV]
	# Convert BGR to HSV
	image_hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image_bgr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
	
	# Display the HSV image
	plt.imshow(image_hsv)
	plt.title('HSV Image')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/HSV"}
	\caption{RGB/BGR to HSV}\label{HSV Image}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Technical Detail:} The conversion from RGB to HSV involves a non-linear transformation that maps the RGB cube to a cylindrical coordinate system.

\subsubsection{RGB/BGR to Lab}

The Lab colour space is designed to be perceptually uniform, meaning that the Euclidean distance between colours in this space approximates human visual perception. It consists of three channels: L* (lightness), a* (green to red), and b* (blue to yellow).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Converting BGR to Lab in OpenCV]
	# Convert BGR to Lab
	image_lab = cv2.cvtColor(image_bgr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2Lab)
	
	# Display the Lab image
	plt.imshow(image_lab)
	plt.title('Lab Image')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Technical Detail:} The Lab colour space is derived from the CIE XYZ colour space, which is based on human vision.

\subsection{Splitting and Merging Colour Channels }

\subsubsection{Splitting Colour Channels}
Splitting an image's colour channels involves separating it into its constituent colour planes. For an RGB (or BGR in OpenCV's default format) image, this means breaking it down into its Red, Green, and Blue components.\cite{Dawson:2014}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Function Used:} \lstinline{cv2.split()}
	\item \textbf{Input:} A multi-channel image (e.g., RGB or BGR).
	\item \textbf{Output:} A list of single-channel images corresponding to each colour plane.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Splitting Colour Channels]
	import cv2
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	
	# Read the image in BGR format
	image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
	
	# Split the image into B, G, R channels
	B, G, R = cv2.split(image)
	
	# Display the individual channels
	plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
	
	plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
	plt.imshow(B, cmap='gray')
	plt.title('Blue Channel')
	
	plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
	plt.imshow(G, cmap='gray')
	plt.title('Green Channel')
	
	plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
	plt.imshow(R, cmap='gray')
	plt.title('Red Channel')
	
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Merging Colour Channels}
Merging colour channels involves combining individual single-channel images into a multi-channel image. This operation is the inverse of splitting and is used when you need to reconstruct the original image after processing individual channels.\cite{Dawson:2014}


\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Function Used:} \lstinline{cv2.merge()}
	\item \textbf{Input:} A list of single-channel images.
	\item \textbf{Output:} A multi-channel image.
\end{itemize}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Merging Colour Channels]
	# Merge the individual channels back into a BGR image
	merged_image = cv2.merge([B, G, R])
	
	# Display the merged image
	plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(merged_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
	plt.title('Merged Image')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Blurring}

Blurring, also known as smoothing, is a fundamental image processing operation used to reduce noise and detail. OpenCV provides several methods for blurring an image, each with distinct properties and use cases.

\subsubsection{Averaging Blur}
The averaging method computes the average of all the pixels under the kernel area and replaces the central pixel with this average. This method effectively reduces noise but can also blur the edges.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Averaging Blur]
	# Read the image
	image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
	
	# Apply averaging blur
	kernel_size = (5, 5)
	blurred_image = cv2.blur(image, kernel_size)
	
	# Display the result
	plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(blurred_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
	plt.title('Averaging Blur')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/AverageBlur"}
	\caption{Averaging Blur}\label{Averaging Blur Image}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gaussian Blur}
Gaussian blurring uses a Gaussian kernel, which gives more weight to the pixels near the center of the kernel. This method is better at preserving edges compared to the averaging method.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Gaussian Blur]
	# Apply Gaussian blur
	kernel_size = (5, 5)
	sigma = 0
	gaussian_blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, kernel_size, sigma)
	
	# Display the result
	plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(gaussian_blurred_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
	plt.title('Gaussian Blur')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/GaussianBlur"}
	\caption{Gaussian Blur}\label{Gaussian Blur Image}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Median Blur}
The median blurring technique replaces each pixel's value with the median value of all the pixels in the kernel area. This method is particularly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise from an image.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Median Blur]
	# Apply median blur
	kernel_size = 5
	median_blurred_image = cv2.medianBlur(image, kernel_size)
	
	# Display the result
	plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(median_blurred_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
	plt.title('Median Blur')
	plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{BITWISE Operations}

Bitwise operations in OpenCV are fundamental tools used in image processing for tasks like masking, merging, and extracting regions of interest (ROI). These operations are performed on a per-bit level, making them highly efficient for pixel-level manipulations. OpenCV provides a set of functions to perform bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

\subsubsection{Bitwise AND}
The bitwise AND operation retains the pixel values where both corresponding pixels in the input images are non-zero. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Bitwise AND]
	import cv2
	import numpy as np
	
	# Create a black image
	image1 = np.zeros((300, 300), dtype="uint8")
	
	# Draw a white rectangle
	cv2.rectangle(image1, (50, 50), (250, 250), 255, -1)
	
	# Create another black image
	image2 = np.zeros((300, 300), dtype="uint8")
	
	# Draw a white circle
	cv2.circle(image2, (150, 150), 100, 255, -1)
	
	# Perform bitwise AND
	bitwise_and = cv2.bitwise_and(image1, image2)
	
	# Display results
	cv2.imshow("Bitwise AND", bitwise_and)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/BitwiseAND"}
	\caption{Bitwise AND}\label{Bitwise AND Image}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bitwise OR}
The bitwise OR operation combines two images, retaining pixel values where at least one of the corresponding pixels in the input images is non-zero.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Bitwise OR]
	# Perform bitwise OR
	bitwise_or = cv2.bitwise_or(image1, image2)
	
	# Display results
	cv2.imshow("Bitwise OR", bitwise_or)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/BitwiseOR"}
	\caption{Bitwise OR}\label{Bitwise OR Image}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Bitwise XOR}
The bitwise XOR operation combines two images, retaining pixel values where one, and only one, of the corresponding pixels in the input images is non-zero.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Bitwise XOR]
	# Perform bitwise XOR
	bitwise_xor = cv2.bitwise_xor(image1, image2)
	
	# Display results
	cv2.imshow("Bitwise XOR", bitwise_xor)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Bitwise NOT}
The bitwise NOT operation inverts the pixel values of an image. All zero-valued pixels become maximum value (255 for 8-bit images) and vice versa.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024,Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Bitwise NOT]
	# Perform bitwise NOT
	bitwise_not = cv2.bitwise_not(image1)
	
	# Display results
	cv2.imshow("Bitwise NOT", bitwise_not)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Masking}

The ability to concentrate on certain areas of an image while disregarding others is known as masking in OpenCV, and it is an essential skill for tasks like object detection, picture segmentation, and feature extraction. In this, a mask is an image that is binary, with the regions of interest being white (255) and the surrounding area being black (0). You can extract the necessary regions from a picture by performing operations like bitwise AND by putting a mask to it. For instance, to mask an image, make a binary mask that has the same measurements as the source image. The mask is then applied to the image using cv2.bitwise and(), emphasizing the areas of interest. To improve the masked image, this method can be expanded to include more intricate procedures like color thresholding and morphological changes.\cite{Dawson:2014}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Masking Example in OpenCV]

# Create a binary mask
mask = np.zeros(image.shape[:2], dtype='uint8')
cv2.circle(mask, (150, 150), 100, 255, -1)  # A white circle

# Apply the mask to the image
masked_image = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask)

# Display the masked image
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(masked_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.title('Masked Image with Circle')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/CircleMask"}
	\caption{Masking Example in OpenCV}\label{Masking Example}
\end{figure}

\section{Face Detection and Recognition}

OpenCV Face detection and recognition are two of its standout capabilities; these are critical for a number of applications, including security systems and human-computer interaction. 

\subsection{Face Detection using Haar Cascades}

Haar Cascades are a popular and efficient method for object detection, including face detection, in images and videos. This technique involves training a cascade function with a series of positive and negative images to detect objects. The method is based on Haar-like features, which are similar to convolutional kernel operations.

\subsubsection{Technical Details}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Haar Features}: These features are simple rectangular areas at a specific location in a detection window, summed up to differentiate between regions of interest and the background. Examples include edge features, line features, and four-rectangle features.
	\item \textbf{Integral Image}: This is used to quickly compute the sum of values in a given rectangular subset of the image. It allows for efficient calculation of Haar features at different scales and locations.
	\item \textbf{AdaBoost Algorithm}: This algorithm selects a small number of important features from a large set and combines them to create a robust classifier. It iteratively adjusts the weights of the training samples to focus on difficult cases.
	\item \textbf{Cascade of Classifiers}: Multiple stages of classifiers are used to reduce the number of false positives. Each stage is trained with increasingly complex features, allowing for efficient detection.\cite{viola:2001}
\end{enumerate}


Here's a simple example of using Haar Cascades for face detection with OpenCV in Python:\cite{Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Haar Cascade Face Detection]
	import cv2
	
	# Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection
	face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
	
	# Read an image
	image = cv2.imread('test_image.jpg')
	gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	
	# Detect faces in the image
	faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_image, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
	
	# Draw rectangles around the detected faces
	for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
	cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)
	
	# Display the output
	cv2.imshow('Face Detection', image)
	cv2.waitKey(0)
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"OpenCV/DetectedFaces"}
	\caption{Face Detection using Haar Cascades}\label{Face Detection using Haar Cascades}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Face Recognition using LBPHFaceRecognizer}


The Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm is a popular method for face recognition due to its simplicity and efficiency. LBPH captures the local structure of the image by comparing each pixel with its surrounding pixels and encoding this information into a binary pattern.

\subsubsection{Technical Details}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Local Binary Patterns (LBP)}: For each pixel, a binary value is generated by thresholding the neighborhood pixels against the central pixel. This binary value is converted to a decimal value, creating a local binary pattern.
	\item \textbf{Histograms}: The image is divided into several regions, and a histogram of LBP values is computed for each region. These histograms are concatenated to form a feature vector representing the image.
	\item \textbf{Training and Prediction}: During training, the LBPHFaceRecognizer computes the histograms for each training image and stores them along with their labels. For recognition, the algorithm computes the histogram for the test image and compares it with the stored histograms using a distance metric (e.g., Chi-square, Euclidean).\cite{viola:2001}
\end{enumerate}


Here's a simple example of using the LBPHFaceRecognizer for face recognition with OpenCV in Python:\cite{Jasmcaus:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=LBPH Face Recognition]
	import cv2
	import numpy as np
	import os
	
	# Create the LBPH face recognizer
	recognizer = cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()
	
	# Function to read training data and labels
	def get_images_and_labels(data_path):
	images, labels = [], []
	for root, dirs, files in os.walk(data_path):
	for file in files:
	if file.endswith('pgm'):
	path = os.path.join(root, file)
	label = int(os.path.basename(root))
	images.append(cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE))
	labels.append(label)
	return images, labels
	
	# Load training data
	data_path = 'face_data'
	images, labels = get_images_and_labels(data_path)
	
	# Train the recognizer
	recognizer.train(images, np.array(labels))
	
	# Read a test image
	test_image = cv2.imread('test_face.pgm', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
	
	# Predict the label of the test image
	label, confidence = recognizer.predict(test_image)
	
	print(f'Predicted label: {label} with confidence: {confidence}')
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Error Handling in OpenCV}

Error handling in OpenCV is crucial for building robust computer vision applications. OpenCV provides mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors gracefully, ensuring that the application can continue to run or fail gracefully without causing unexpected behavior. Common errors in OpenCV include file I/O errors, invalid operations on images, and hardware compatibility issues. To handle these errors, OpenCV uses C++ style exceptions, which can be caught and managed in Python using try-except blocks. For instance, when attempting to read an image file that doesn't exist, OpenCV will raise a \texttt{cv2.error} exception. This can be caught and handled to notify the user or take corrective action, preventing the application from crashing.\cite{Jasmcaus:2024,OpenCVTeam:2024}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Example of error handling in OpenCV]
	import cv2
	
	try:
	# Attempt to read an image
	image = cv2.imread('non_existent_file.jpg')
	if image is None:
	raise FileNotFoundError("The image file was not found.")
	# Perform operations on the image
	except cv2.error as e:
	print(f"OpenCV error: {e}")
	except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
	print(fnf_error)
	except Exception as e:
	print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, \texttt{cv2.error} catches specific OpenCV-related errors, while \texttt{FileNotFoundError} handles cases where the image file is not found. Using generic \texttt{Exception} ensures that any other unforeseen errors are also caught, maintaining the stability of the application. This structured error handling approach allows developers to provide meaningful feedback to users and implement fallback strategies, which is essential for creating reliable computer vision systems.\cite{OpenCVTeam:2024} 

\section{Example : File Uploads and Management}

OpenCV is extensively utilized for image processing and analysis. One of the key functionalities developers often require is handling file uploads and managing these files efficiently. In this context, integrating OpenCV with file upload mechanisms involves a series of technical steps. Typically, developers employ frameworks like Flask or Django to create a backend that handles HTTP requests for file uploads. These frameworks facilitate the reception and storage of image files uploaded by users. Once an image is uploaded, it can be read using OpenCV's \PYTHON{cv2.imread()} function, which converts the image file into a format suitable for processing. This initial step ensures that the image is correctly loaded into memory for further manipulation and analysis.

Post-upload management involves a variety of tasks, such as validating the uploaded file type, resizing images to standard dimensions, converting images between different color spaces, and performing operations like filtering, edge detection, and transformation. OpenCV's extensive suite of functions enables these operations, providing methods like \PYTHON{cv2.resize()}, \PYTHON{cv2.cvtColor()}, and \PYTHON{cv2.filter2D()}. Additionally, effective file management might include organizing files into directories based on their attributes or intended use, and potentially integrating with cloud storage solutions for scalability. For instance, images could be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, and their URLs saved in a database for easy retrieval and processing. This comprehensive approach to file uploads and management ensures that images are not only efficiently handled but are also readily available for real-time processing and analysis, enhancing the overall application performance and user experience. \cite{OpenCVTeam:2024}
