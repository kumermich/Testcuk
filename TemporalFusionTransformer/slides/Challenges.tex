\begin{itemize}
	\item Transformer is a type of artificial neural network introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention is all you need" by Google's researchers.
	\item Originally developed for machine translation, Transformer models have been adapted for various tasks including image identification, voice production, video analysis, and forecasting.
	\item Transformer models utilize a technique called "Self-Attention" to focus on different parts of the input sequence, enabling effective identification of long-term dependencies in the data.\newpage
	\item The Transformer model consists of an encoder-decoder architecture. Input data undergoes an encoding process in the encoder block, and the resulting output is used in the decoder block along with previous output data to generate predictions.
	\item The encoder-decoder architecture of Transformer separates the model into two parts, allowing for efficient processing of sequential data and generation of accurate predictions.\cite{Jittanon:2023}
